# Channels Reference

This document is the canonical reference for channel configuration in ZeroClaw.

For encrypted Matrix rooms, also read the dedicated runbook:
- [Matrix E2EE Guide](./matrix-e2ee-guide.md)

## Quick Paths

- Need a full config reference by channel: jump to [Per-Channel Config Examples](#4-per-channel-config-examples).
- Need a no-response diagnosis flow: jump to [Troubleshooting Checklist](#6-troubleshooting-checklist).
- Need Matrix encrypted-room help: use [Matrix E2EE Guide](./matrix-e2ee-guide.md).
- Need Nextcloud Talk bot setup: use [Nextcloud Talk Setup](./nextcloud-talk-setup.md).
- Need deployment/network assumptions (polling vs webhook): use [Network Deployment](./network-deployment.md).

## FAQ: Matrix setup passes but no reply

This is the most common symptom (same class as issue #499). Check these in order:

1. **Allowlist mismatch**: `allowed_users` does not include the sender (or is empty).
2. **Wrong room target**: bot is not joined to the configured `room_id` / alias target room.
3. **Token/account mismatch**: token is valid but belongs to another Matrix account.
4. **E2EE device identity gap**: `whoami` does not return `device_id` and config does not provide one.
5. **Key sharing/trust gap**: room keys were not shared to the bot device, so encrypted events cannot be decrypted.
6. **Stale runtime state**: config changed but `zeroclaw daemon` was not restarted.

---

## 1. Configuration Namespace

All channel settings live under `channels_config` in `~/.zeroclaw/config.toml`.

```toml
[channels_config]
cli = true
```

Each channel is enabled by creating its sub-table (for example, `[channels_config.telegram]`).

## In-Chat Runtime Model Switching (Telegram / Discord)

When running `zeroclaw channel start` (or daemon mode), Telegram and Discord now support sender-scoped runtime switching:

- `/models` — show available providers and current selection
- `/models <provider>` — switch provider for the current sender session
- `/model` — show current model and cached model IDs (if available)
- `/model <model-id>` — switch model for the current sender session
- `/new` — clear conversation history and start a fresh session

Notes:

- Switching provider or model clears only that sender's in-memory conversation history to avoid cross-model context contamination.
- `/new` clears the sender's conversation history without changing provider or model selection.
- Model cache previews come from `zeroclaw models refresh --provider <ID>`.
- These are runtime chat commands, not CLI subcommands.

## Inbound Image Marker Protocol

ZeroClaw supports multimodal input through inline message markers:

- Syntax: ``[IMAGE:<source>]``
- `<source>` can be:
  - Local file path
  - Data URI (`data:image/...;base64,...`)
  - Remote URL only when `[multimodal].allow_remote_fetch = true`

Operational notes:

- Marker parsing applies to user-role messages before provider calls.
- Provider capability is enforced at runtime: if the selected provider does not support vision, the request fails with a structured capability error (`capability=vision`).
- Linq webhook `media` parts with `image/*` MIME type are automatically converted to this marker format.

## Channel Matrix

### Build Feature Toggles (`channel-matrix`, `channel-lark`)

Matrix and Lark support are controlled at compile time.

- Default builds are lean (`default = []`) and do not include Matrix/Lark.
- Typical local check with only hardware support:

```bash
cargo check --features hardware
```

- Enable Matrix explicitly when needed:

```bash
cargo check --features hardware,channel-matrix
```

- Enable Lark explicitly when needed:

```bash
cargo check --features hardware,channel-lark
```

If `[channels_config.matrix]`, `[channels_config.lark]`, or `[channels_config.feishu]` is present but the corresponding feature is not compiled in, `zeroclaw channel list`, `zeroclaw channel doctor`, and `zeroclaw channel start` will report that the channel is intentionally skipped for this build.

## 2. Delivery Modes at a Glance

| Channel | Receive mode | Public inbound port required? |
|---|---|---|
| CLI | local stdin/stdout | No |
| Telegram | polling | No |
| Discord | gateway/websocket | No |
| Slack | events API | No (token-based channel flow) |
| Mattermost | polling | No |
| Matrix | sync API (supports E2EE) | No |
| Signal | signal-cli HTTP bridge | No (local bridge endpoint) |
| WhatsApp | webhook (Cloud API) or websocket (Web mode) | Cloud API: Yes (public HTTPS callback), Web mode: No |
| Nextcloud Talk | webhook (`/nextcloud-talk`) | Yes (public HTTPS callback) |
| Webhook | gateway endpoint (`/webhook`) | Usually yes |
| Email | IMAP polling + SMTP send | No |
| IRC | IRC socket | No |
| Lark | websocket (default) or webhook | Webhook mode only |
| Feishu | websocket (default) or webhook | Webhook mode only |
| DingTalk | stream mode | No |
| QQ | bot gateway | No |
| Linq | webhook (`/linq`) | Yes (public HTTPS callback) |
| iMessage | local integration | No |
| Nostr | relay websocket (NIP-04 / NIP-17) | No |

---

## 3. Allowlist Semantics

For channels with inbound sender allowlists:

- Empty allowlist: deny all inbound messages.
- `"*"`: allow all inbound senders (use for temporary verification only).
- Explicit list: allow only listed senders.

Field names differ by channel:

- `allowed_users` (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Mattermost/Matrix/IRC/Lark/Feishu/DingTalk/QQ/Nextcloud Talk)
- `allowed_from` (Signal)
- `allowed_numbers` (WhatsApp)
- `allowed_senders` (Email/Linq)
- `allowed_contacts` (iMessage)
- `allowed_pubkeys` (Nostr)

---

## 4. Per-Channel Config Examples

### 4.1 Telegram

```toml
[channels_config.telegram]
bot_token = "123456:telegram-token"
allowed_users = ["*"]
stream_mode = "off"               # optional: off | partial
draft_update_interval_ms = 1000   # optional: edit throttle for partial streaming
mention_only = false              # optional: require @mention in groups
interrupt_on_new_message = false  # optional: cancel in-flight same-sender same-chat request
```

Telegram notes:

- `interrupt_on_new_message = true` preserves interrupted user turns in conversation history, then restarts generation on the newest message.
- Interruption scope is strict: same sender in the same chat. Messages from different chats are processed independently.

### 4.2 Discord

```toml
[channels_config.discord]
bot_token = "discord-bot-token"
guild_id = "123456789012345678"   # optional
allowed_users = ["*"]
listen_to_bots = false
mention_only = false
```

### 4.3 Slack

```toml
[channels_config.slack]
bot_token = "xoxb-..."
app_token = "xapp-..."             # optional
channel_id = "C1234567890"         # optional: single channel; omit or "*" for all accessible channels
allowed_users = ["*"]
```

Slack listen behavior:

- `channel_id = "C123..."`: listen only on that channel.
- `channel_id = "*"` or omitted: auto-discover and listen across all accessible channels.

### 4.4 Mattermost

```toml
[channels_config.mattermost]
url = "https://mm.example.com"
bot_token = "mattermost-token"
channel_id = "channel-id"          # required for listening
allowed_users = ["*"]
```

### 4.5 Matrix

```toml
[channels_config.matrix]
homeserver = "https://matrix.example.com"
access_token = "syt_..."
user_id = "@zeroclaw:matrix.example.com"   # optional, recommended for E2EE
device_id = "DEVICEID123"                  # optional, recommended for E2EE
room_id = "!room:matrix.example.com"       # or room alias (#ops:matrix.example.com)
allowed_users = ["*"]
```

See [Matrix E2EE Guide](./matrix-e2ee-guide.md) for encrypted-room troubleshooting.

### 4.6 Signal

```toml
[channels_config.signal]
http_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8686"
account = "+1234567890"
group_id = "dm"                    # optional: "dm" / group id / omitted
allowed_from = ["*"]
ignore_attachments = false
ignore_stories = true
```

### 4.7 WhatsApp

ZeroClaw supports two WhatsApp backends:

- **Cloud API mode** (`phone_number_id` + `access_token` + `verify_token`)
- **WhatsApp Web mode** (`session_path`, requires build flag `--features whatsapp-web`)

Cloud API mode:

```toml
[channels_config.whatsapp]
access_token = "EAAB..."
phone_number_id = "123456789012345"
verify_token = "your-verify-token"
app_secret = "your-app-secret"     # optional but recommended
allowed_numbers = ["*"]
```

WhatsApp Web mode:

```toml
[channels_config.whatsapp]
session_path = "~/.zeroclaw/state/whatsapp-web/session.db"
pair_phone = "15551234567"         # optional; omit to use QR flow
pair_code = ""                     # optional custom pair code
allowed_numbers = ["*"]
```

Notes:

- Build with `cargo build --features whatsapp-web` (or equivalent run command).
- Keep `session_path` on persistent storage to avoid relinking after restart.
- Reply routing uses the originating chat JID, so direct and group replies work correctly.

### 4.8 Webhook Channel Config (Gateway)

`channels_config.webhook` enables webhook-specific gateway behavior.

```toml
[channels_config.webhook]
port = 8080
secret = "optional-shared-secret"
```

Run with gateway/daemon and verify `/health`.

### 4.9 Email

```toml
[channels_config.email]
imap_host = "imap.example.com"
imap_port = 993
imap_folder = "INBOX"
smtp_host = "smtp.example.com"
smtp_port = 465
smtp_tls = true
username = "bot@example.com"
password = "email-password"
from_address = "bot@example.com"
poll_interval_secs = 60
allowed_senders = ["*"]
```

### 4.10 IRC

```toml
[channels_config.irc]
server = "irc.libera.chat"
port = 6697
nickname = "zeroclaw-bot"
username = "zeroclaw"              # optional
channels = ["#zeroclaw"]
allowed_users = ["*"]
server_password = ""                # optional
nickserv_password = ""              # optional
sasl_password = ""                  # optional
verify_tls = true
```

### 4.11 Lark

```toml
[channels_config.lark]
app_id = "cli_xxx"
app_secret = "xxx"
encrypt_key = ""                    # optional
verification_token = ""             # optional
allowed_users = ["*"]
mention_only = false              # optional: require @mention in groups (DMs always allowed)
use_feishu = false
receive_mode = "websocket"          # or "webhook"
port = 8081                          # required for webhook mode
```

### 4.12 Feishu

```toml
[channels_config.feishu]
app_id = "cli_xxx"
app_secret = "xxx"
encrypt_key = ""                    # optional
verification_token = ""             # optional
allowed_users = ["*"]
receive_mode = "websocket"          # or "webhook"
port = 8081                          # required for webhook mode
```

Migration note:

- Legacy config `[channels_config.lark] use_feishu = true` is still supported for backward compatibility.
- Prefer `[channels_config.feishu]` for new setups.

### 4.13 Nostr

```toml
[channels_config.nostr]
private_key = "nsec1..."                   # hex or nsec bech32 (encrypted at rest)
# relays default to relay.damus.io, nos.lol, relay.primal.net, relay.snort.social
# relays = ["wss://relay.damus.io", "wss://nos.lol"]
allowed_pubkeys = ["hex-or-npub"]          # empty = deny all, "*" = allow all
```

Nostr supports both NIP-04 (legacy encrypted DMs) and NIP-17 (gift-wrapped private messages).
Replies automatically use the same protocol the sender used. The private key is encrypted at rest
via the `SecretStore` when `secrets.encrypt = true` (the default).

Interactive onboarding support:

```bash
zeroclaw onboard --interactive
```

The wizard now includes dedicated **Lark** and **Feishu** steps with:

- credential verification against official Open Platform auth endpoint
- receive mode selection (`websocket` or `webhook`)
- optional webhook verification token prompt (recommended for stronger callback authenticity checks)

Runtime token behavior:

- `tenant_access_token` is cached with a refresh deadline based on `expire`/`expires_in` from the auth response.
- send requests automatically retry once after token invalidation when Feishu/Lark returns either HTTP `401` or business error code `99991663` (`Invalid access token`).
- if the retry still returns token-invalid responses, the send call fails with the upstream status/body for easier troubleshooting.

### 4.14 DingTalk

```toml
[channels_config.dingtalk]
client_id = "ding-app-key"
client_secret = "ding-app-secret"
allowed_users = ["*"]
```

### 4.15 QQ

```toml
[channels_config.qq]
app_id = "qq-app-id"
app_secret = "qq-app-secret"
allowed_users = ["*"]
```

### 4.16 Nextcloud Talk

```toml
[channels_config.nextcloud_talk]
base_url = "https://cloud.example.com"
app_token = "nextcloud-talk-app-token"
webhook_secret = "optional-webhook-secret"  # optional but recommended
allowed_users = ["*"]
```

Notes:

- Inbound webhook endpoint: `POST /nextcloud-talk`.
- Signature verification uses `X-Nextcloud-Talk-Random` and `X-Nextcloud-Talk-Signature`.
- If `webhook_secret` is set, invalid signatures are rejected with `401`.
- `ZEROCLAW_NEXTCLOUD_TALK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` overrides config secret.
- See [nextcloud-talk-setup.md](./nextcloud-talk-setup.md) for a full runbook.

### 4.16 Linq

```toml
[channels_config.linq]
api_token = "linq-partner-api-token"
from_phone = "+15551234567"
signing_secret = "optional-webhook-signing-secret"  # optional but recommended
allowed_senders = ["*"]
```

Notes:

- Linq uses the Partner V3 API for iMessage, RCS, and SMS.
- Inbound webhook endpoint: `POST /linq`.
- Signature verification uses `X-Webhook-Signature` (HMAC-SHA256) and `X-Webhook-Timestamp`.
- If `signing_secret` is set, invalid or stale (>300s) signatures are rejected.
- `ZEROCLAW_LINQ_SIGNING_SECRET` overrides config secret.
- `allowed_senders` uses E.164 phone number format (e.g. `+1234567890`).

### 4.17 iMessage

```toml
[channels_config.imessage]
allowed_contacts = ["*"]
```

---

## 5. Validation Workflow

1. Configure one channel with permissive allowlist (`"*"`) for initial verification.
2. Run:

```bash
zeroclaw onboard --channels-only
zeroclaw daemon
```

1. Send a message from an expected sender.
2. Confirm a reply arrives.
3. Tighten allowlist from `"*"` to explicit IDs.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Checklist

If a channel appears connected but does not respond:

1. Confirm the sender identity is allowed by the correct allowlist field.
2. Confirm bot account membership/permissions in target room/channel.
3. Confirm tokens/secrets are valid (and not expired/revoked).
4. Confirm transport mode assumptions:
   - polling/websocket channels do not need public inbound HTTP
   - webhook channels do need reachable HTTPS callback
5. Restart `zeroclaw daemon` after config changes.

- [Matrix E2EE Guide](./matrix-e2ee-guide.md)

## 7. Operations Appendix: Log Keywords Matrix

Use this appendix for fast triage. Match log keywords first, then follow the troubleshooting steps above.

### 7.1 Recommended capture command

```bash
RUST_LOG=info zeroclaw daemon 2>&1 | tee /tmp/zeroclaw.log
```

Then filter channel/gateway events:

```bash
rg -n "Matrix|Telegram|Discord|Slack|Mattermost|Signal|WhatsApp|Email|IRC|Lark|DingTalk|QQ|iMessage|Nostr|Webhook|Channel" /tmp/zeroclaw.log
```

### 7.3 Runtime supervisor keywords

If a specific channel task crashes or exits, the channel supervisor in `channels/mod.rs` emits:

- `Channel <name> exited unexpectedly; restarting`
- `Channel <name> error: ...; restarting`
- `Channel message worker crashed:`

These messages indicate automatic restart behavior is active, and you should inspect preceding logs for root cause.
