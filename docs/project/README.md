# Project Snapshot & Triage Docs

Time-bound project status snapshots for planning documentation and operations work.

## Current Snapshot

- [../project-triage-snapshot-2026-02-18.md](../project-triage-snapshot-2026-02-18.md)
- [../docs-audit-2026-02-24.md](../docs-audit-2026-02-24.md)

## Scope

Project snapshots are time-bound assessments of open PRs, issues, and documentation health. Use these to:

- Identify documentation gaps driven by feature work
- Prioritize docs maintenance alongside code changes
- Track evolving PR/issue pressure over time

For stable documentation classification (not time-bound), use [docs-inventory.md](../docs-inventory.md).
