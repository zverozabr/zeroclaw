//! Task Classifier for ZeroClaw Economic Agents
//!
//! Classifies work instructions into 44 BLS occupations with wage data
//! to estimate task value for agent economics.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The classifier matches task instructions to standardized occupation
//! categories using keyword matching and heuristics, then calculates
//! expected payment based on BLS hourly wage data.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use zeroclaw::economic::classifier::{TaskClassifier, OccupationCategory};
//!
//! let classifier = TaskClassifier::new();
//! let result = classifier.classify("Write a REST API in Rust").await?;
//!
//! println!("Occupation: {}", result.occupation);
//! println!("Hourly wage: ${:.2}", result.hourly_wage);
//! println!("Estimated hours: {:.2}", result.estimated_hours);
//! println!("Max payment: ${:.2}", result.max_payment);
//! ```
